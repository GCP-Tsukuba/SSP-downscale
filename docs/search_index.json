In the estimation, national GDP data (past data until 2010; future projection under SSPs after 2020) is downscaled considering spatial and economic interactions among cities, urban growth patterns compatible with SSPs, and other auxiliary geographic data (land cover, road network, etc.). Methods which we used are detaily described in our forthcoming paper and data: Murakami, Yoshida, and Yamagata (202X). Figure: Europe in 2D Figure: Asia in 2D Figure: Interactive 3D globe maping on downscaled GDP of SSP2-2100. You can pan and zoom the globe by mouse-over. Data download The GDPs for SSP 1–5 between 2010 and 2100 by 10 years are estimated by 2160 x 4320 grids, each of which are 1/12-degree grids, covering the globe. The GDP estimates in each year in each SSP are recorded as a GeoTIff image with resolution of 2160 x 4320. GeoTiff is a Tiff image with spatial coordinates for each grid cell; the coordinates are given by longitude and latitude measured by World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84).
